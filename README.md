# Big-Data-Genomic-Sequencing

- Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the project is to propose a solution to handle the big data involved in Genomic sequencing by building a fast, scalable and a cost effective system that provides a highly paralleled batch processing capability for sequencing genome for multiple users.

This solution offers motivation for implementation of large-scale and cost effective whole genome sequencing analysis in the cloud by leveraging Amazon cloud services, Hadoop, efficient Bowtie and SOAP Snp algorithms for alignment and SNP detection. 
As of now the solution to genome sequencing has been restricted to research laboratories and far from the clinical reach. Thus we believe this solution can serve as a basis for taking computational biology to a new commercialized level by utilizing it to conduct a wave of citywide genome analysis to detect and cure diseases by inventing personalized medicines.
